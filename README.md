## Reflection

This was a 3 week long final project built during the Web Development Program at Eleven Fifty Academy. The purpose of the project was to learn how to take what we had learned, read through documentation to further our knowledge and build an app using Typescript in React with Class Components.

I set out to build an app that would fill the need in today's society to have well informed dialog. The purpose was to organize major media news outlet's stories by conservative and liberal as people tend to fall into an algorithm that is tracked across the internet and therefore gives you suggestions, that if followed, can potentially give you a narrow perception about what's going on. The user is able to choose from conservative or liberal with a color mode switch and search the api by keywords to look up specific topics and the registered user is then able tp store a collection of articles into entries with written details about the collection.

Some of the main challenges I ran into were figuring out what specific types to use, grasping the concepts of state, props, and passing them especially using Redirect. This was resulted in spending a lot of time looking back on past lessons, reading more in-depth into the React Router documentation, and searching the internet for forums and articles with hopeful solutions to problems.

The technologies I implemented in this project were predominantly React, React-Router 5.3, Typescript, JSX, PostgresSQL, and for styling Styled Components, Reactstrap/Bootstrap, and some minor amounts of CSS.
